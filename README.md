## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"[Field Name] cannot be empty"_
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Looks like this is not an email"_

### What I learned

During this project I learned about the caret-color CSS property which sets the color of the insertion caret, sometimes referred to as the text input cursor, the visible marker where the next character typed will be inserted.

```css
input {
  caret-color: blue;
}
```
